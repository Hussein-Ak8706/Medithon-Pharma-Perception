Our next step was going to be Xolair because her pulmonary doctor said we were running out of options. With Alvesco, my daughter's asthma is the best controlled it has ever been! I am just praying it continues to work like it has the past two years. She is in a high dose--4 puffs a day @ 160 mg to control severe asthma.","I used to take Flovent and I had no issues with it. My allergist decided to switch me to Alvesco instead and she told me it would work the same as Flovent, the only difference being that Id only have to take the inhaler once before bed everyday. At first, the side effects weren't that noticeable. My appetite changed and id start to feel sick when I ate, my mouth and throat would get dry and my chest would feel tight. While at work, it would feel like I was breathing in cold air and like I had a lump in my throat. I also noticed that I would get extremely tired and had no energy or motivation to do anything. On the fifth week, the mood changes were at their worst. I started feeling extremely anxious about everything and would have terrible racing thoughts.

Then I had trouble walking or driving for weeks because of dizziness. Flashbacks for a year. Psychosis is a living nightmare I was so terrified I couldn't control my thoughts by heart was beating almost 200 bpm. I'd never take it again even for a billion dollars. One doctor saw it as my allergy and said ""What happened? You go crazy?"" I said yes, and he said that happens to a lot of people because it's a drug for Parkinson's and shouldn't be given to people with normal brains. Take tamiflu or vitamins or anything else besides this drug for the flu.

All of these things are TERRIBLY out of character. Only after a full three weeks did my husband say ""He is acting like he does when he is on that steroid."" (he has behavioral issues whenever he is very ill and has to do a round of prednisone)... It was like a lightbulb went off over my head! I took him off of the Asmanex and returned to using the Pulmicort. Within two days his teacher said he was a completely different child! She confided in me that she was actually preparing to contact me for a meeting to discuss the possibility of testing for ADHD, or even to see if my son was on the autism spectrum. I am really glad we made the connectio",,
ASPIRIN,just one 70 mg tablet wrapped in cheeseTaken by a dog- 32 pounds for 1x a day for 2 days. Don't give your dog NSAIDS like ibruprofen or motrin or advil. Best to check with your vet but my vet ok'd the baby (low dose) asprin for my dog. Really helped her feel better.,Works better than Tylenol which is pretty much useless. But only helps slightly with OA and joint pain. I don’t take it daily only occasionally.,,
ASTELIN,"After reading other comments, I too wonder if my thigh and calf aches were truly not from exercise as others experienced the same. Once Astelin was discontinued the issues stopped. Will never use again!",Terrible drug.,,

ATELVIA,"I started taking Atelvia four years ago for osteoporosis. It was great being able to take this medication immediately after eating breakfast. After two years, my dexa scan showed an improvement in bone density to the level of osteopenia. I have been taking calcium and do weight bearing exercise on a regular basis, so I was shocked when my latest dexa scan this year showed a slight decrease in bone density to the level of osteoporosis. My doctor suggested trying an IV infusion treatment or continuing Atelvia for another year and another dexa next year. I determined that the IV option was not a good idea for me, due to the long term possibility of side effects. Now I have a dilemma - my new healthcare provider does not cover Atelvia at all. Paying out of pocket would cost me nearly $5000 for the whole year. The only covered options are generic actonel or fosamax. She also suggested Evista, but due to family history of stroke and heart disease, this is not a risk I want to take. It would be nice if there was a generic version of Atelvia available.","I started taking Atelvia four years ago for osteoporosis.

ATIVAN,Saved my life when my son passed. I never take more than one a day. I try not to take them every day so lots of time between doses. Just knowing I have them is comforting in itself.,This drug should only be used as a one-off treatment! This class of drug is EVIL,,
ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM,"Doctors claim that it can help prevent heart attacks 36% which is a fudged BigPharma number. The TRUE number is 1.9% and even that is from a ""study"" ??? By the time I realized I was scammed it was too late cuz major damage was done. Far safer to take a name brand Red Yeast Rice like HPF Cholestene or Sylvan brand VERY IMPORTANT to only take these two brands cuz most either aren't effective OR have harmful contaminants .

ATRALIN,"My dermatologist prescribed this when I inquired about a solution to my ageing face skin texture. No not wrinkles, all the other annoying changes to the skin on my face. I use it all the time, skipping days here and there. The improvement was noticeable to me as well as my wife after a couple of weeks. Its tightens the skin and made it smoother. Its prescribed for acne but by removing dead skin in the process it leaves behind some great results and a little goes a long way.

AUGMENTIN  125,"Doctor prescribed this to me to prevent the spread of an infection in my arm. For that reason, it worked wonderfully. After the abscess was drained my doctor said the wound looked great and the redness from the infection ceased in my arm. But I had diarrhea halfway through the second day and it lasted through the end of the treatment period despite trying to take probiotics to help it. Then on the eighth day I broke out into a rash, very similar to hives, all over my body. My doctor suggested benadryl to alleviate the itching. This medicine did what it was supposed to do; it just came with side effects that made me feel worse than I already did.",Made me feel worse I would rather deal with the pain in my lung then to take this horrible medication.,,
AUGMENTIN 250,"Sooner Drs except that antibiotics cause all these symptoms that are not listed the better, these are powerful drugs that get dished out like sweets","Worked for the infection (so far), NASTY taste when taking the liquid form. Chalky, gritty, crunchy, awful taste.",,
AUGMENTIN 875,It got rid of my severe sinus infection really quick and I didn't have side effects from the drugs first 4-5 days. Thankfully it cleared it so quick because the side effects from the drug are a nightmare. I had to quit taking day 8. Will never take this again!!!,Worst drug I have ever taken. Never again!,,
AUGMENTIN XR,I feel better but the pain is intense.,"This medication worked great to kick the streps butt, unfortunately, around day 4 it started kicking mine as well. The only other antibiotic i have ever had any trouble with was e-mycin, with that one i had uncotrolled vomitting immediately, so this one is a bit sneakier. I would definitely try something milder like Keflex 1st, but if you cant, take lots of probiotics and be ready to become a whiney baby for a while because you may feel like crap.",,

AVIANE-28,I got pregnant in December 2018 and just recently began taking aviane after being off for the duration of my pregnancy. I have experienced no side effects this second time around.,Started taking Aviane 2 days after my menstrual cycle had ended. I took it for 5 days and am extremely bloated and experiencing the WORST vaginal bleeding I've ever had. It started out as light spotting and now it's horrible and so is the cramping that came along with it. I've stopped taking it and wouldn't recommend this pill to anyone.,,
AVINZA,After being in constant unbearable pain for four years this drug works like nothing else. It is a miracle for me. No the pain is not all gone (how I wish I could go up to 90) but it makes life worth living and I can get through each day with mild/moderate pain. For constipation I just take five magnesium pills a day which I figure can help relax muscles also. Also fibro friends try trigger point therapy. It is wonderful!!!,"This medicine saved my life! A new mom, w/ small children when I got hurt & had so much pain life was unbearable!This is the only thing that works to take my pain away enough to manage life. To me,it is a miracle. I do hate the side effects, but all close family&friends know my loopy-ness is from the drug. Im thankful for this med as I KNOW I would NOT have made it w/o it.

AVITA,I love this stuff! After only 1 month my face better than it has ever been. It has really helped get rid of the blackheads and cloged pores.,"Had horrible acne as a teenager and as an adult.

AVODART,overall it is good for low urine,"This is the second time in 2 years that I have taken this drug....with a 6 month break in between. Symptoms began 20 - 30 days after starting the drug. The drug helps w/shrinking the prostate, but the side effects are miserable.",,
AVONEX,"Works great, had a relapse after year one, and one year 5 but considering that I began with numbness and a blind spot in my eye, this works great, everyone needs to find what works best for them but this has been great for me.",I need to take break. Medicine is good but the sickness has gotten me to stay home and not to even enjoy weekends or my kids. Can't do it during the week cuz of work. So tired of this ms crap. Hurry up and find a cure already.,,
AXERT,"Axert is my wonder drug. After trying most every 'new' migraine medication out there, my doctor finally decided to try some of the older ones. Axert usually relieves my migraines on the first pill. If not, you can take a second one after one hour. I don't go anywhere without them.",I like this drug…it works well and has very few side effects.,,
AXID,"My son has been taking Axid for about 5 months (since he was 2 months old). He has Reflux and while the Axid doesn't do much to eliminate the Reflux, it has made his discomfort much better.","Adverse effects were so severe I had to quit taking this. Effects only wore off 5 days after taking it. I also have Sjogren's syndrome, I wonder if this has any bearing on the side effects.... Irony is that clinical studies claim nizatidine might acutally be beneficial for Sjogren's as it could increase saliva production. Unfortunately, I did not notice this effect either, but maybe I gave up too soon....",,
AXIRON,Considering I rarely get all of the product applied without dripping some off I seem to be feeling a lot better since starting with axiron. While it is messy I think it is way better than sticky androgel on your back and abs or stinky testim. So far its the best topical T I have used in the last 5 years. I'm on 2 squirts and will have T checked in another month or so.,"It raised my low T from 100 to 250. That gave me energy to get through the day. However, when I ran out of it for a month, I barely had enough energy to get out of bed, and my thinking became foggy. I dragged myself through the day. Not all patients absorb this product well, so you have to have your testosterone checked regularly. If your testosterone level is not too low, I advise against taking it because once you have taken it for several years, you may notice some shrinkage of the testes, as I did.",,
AYGESTIN,Wish it would've worked. For the first two weeks I felt great and then a mental prison and rage.,"Just stopped taking Aygestin about 10 days ago. Heavy bleeding, severe leg cramps, tiredness, breast tenderness started about 3 days ago. Not sure how long the effects will last.",,
AZASITE,"I was using this off-label to treat my dry eyes. Because of the expense and concerns about long term use, I did not use Azasite often. In 2010, I went through three, three week courses, and it was wonderful. My eyes were comfortable, and the little bumps in my eyelid went away. However, in 2015 and 2016, I tried the medication again, and it gave me unbearable headaches both times. I don't know if I have become allergic or sensitive to something in the drops, or whether the new owner of the patent somehow changed the formula and added something that was not there in 2010. At any rate, I cannot use them any more.","I could not use restasis since it made my eyes drier, so then I started using azasite and I'm pretty much back to normal.",,
AZATHIOPRINE,Help me get into remission and stay there for the last 2 years. Using along with Lialda 4tablets per day.,Have been on this drug for approx 3 weeks but have really bad nausea. Im only on 50 mg. Has anyone else taken this drug for Pemphigus Vulgaris and will my nausea improve?,,

AZITHROMYCIN,felt better after 5 days - also taking cough med and prednisone and was prescribed an inhaler,Horrible drug.,,

More than one Dr. has tried to sell me on advair, but my current drugs are working great for me...so why change?",I am now taking 4 puffs 2x daily with Singulair each day to get me off the albuterol.

Need to know that I will be able to continue to do this.,"I've been taking this medication for about 14 years, 2000mg per day, but 3000mg per day for the past year.

BACIIM,have alot of allergies!,have alot of allergies!,,
BACLOFEN,This medication allows my stomach to relax and I can eat food again after not eating for seven months. Happy to leave a review and hope it helps someone else like it has me.,A horrible drug that made my overall situation worse. Did nothing for the original pain/strain. Waste of money and time. Could have been on a better medication sooner. Had no idea all side effects were tied to this drug. I only took half of the prescribed daily dose and still had a terrible experience with it.,,
BACTRIM,"I also experienced joint/tendon pain in my wrists while taking bactrim that is still present. I'm not sure if this is related to the drug bc from what I've read, this isn't a common side effect. I have experienced joint pain with Cipro (cipro was a nightmare)",I hate this drug,,
BACTRIM PEDIATRIC,Took for thirty days worked great.,"Bactrim was the ONLY drug that ever cleared up not only my adult cystic acne, but also regular acne and blackheads -- an embarrassing and nasty issue I had dealt with since I was in college.

BENLYSTA,"Highly recommend that you drink TONS of water 5 hours prior to injection and a pre med dose of Benadryl.

BENZAMYCIN,Have used for 8 weeks now. Has improved my acne by about 90% from when I started. Very good drug. Only problem is I have a lot of scars and red marks.

Went off birth control and started breaking out, went back on the pill (a new one) and developed horrible cystic acne along my jawline and chin. Some cysts were staying around 5-6 weeks and were horribly inflamed and painful. Nothing was helping. I am on week 3 of this medication and so far am ecstatic at the improvement I'm seeing. I hope it continues. Cysts started flattening some about 3 days after I started using this medication. Reduces inflammation a lot. I am still breaking out but it seems like the pimples are less severe and much quicker to go away. I'm hoping it helps with some of the hyperpigmentation that I have now.

I’ve been treated with topicals and typical doses of fluconazole. If it clears my doctor wants me to take fluconazole permanently on a weekly basis as a preventative measure.

Like all painkillers used for migraine (including OTC remedies), use sparingly to avoid the vicious cycle of rebound headaches. The only way to cure those is to use NOTHING AT ALL for a full month, then start with very small and sparing dosages of OTC remedies.

I can see that I am acting aggressive and crazy, but I can't seem to stop the reaction. I got my testosterone checked and it is high, 68.

"DEXTROAMP SACCHARATE, AMP ASPARTATE, DEXTROAMP SULFATE AND AMP SULFATE","This has been a wonderful tool for assisting me in maintaining focus and increasing my desire to accomplish tasks set before me, yet it also increases my desire to over-achieve in areas which are not pertinent to daily tasks. Prior to this regimen I was constantly irritable, and short-tempered, yet while currently on this drug, I am on an even plane. Occasionally I feel ""emotionally neutered"". Ampheta is an extremely addictive drug that can easily be abused and cause adverse conditions to the life of the individual if the regimen is not strictly followed. Sad story, one of my friends is on the drug and takes his prescription amount within half of the allotted time given. Most of the time this person is sleeping for days, or up for days. This would seem to be the life altering outcome that one would wish to avoid.","Initially, when I started this drug 20 years ago, there was no generic for the XR version and it was a life altering drug. I was on top of everything. Never had a bad day. When the generic came out of XR it was dissapointing at best, so I switched to regular adderral. Don't be naive and think taking this drug long term won't have any consequences, because it does. The artificial induction of stimulation from this drug eventually depletes your bodies reservoir in every way imaginable. I have chronic fatigue and rheumatoid arthritis after 20 years of using Adderral. True, it may not be related, but it feels exactly the way I felt when I would not take Adderral over the weekend. I could not move from the couch and had no ambition whatsoever. RA is the same thing only all the over exerting I did while on Adderral, is suddenly apparent in my bones and joints.

Truly the best joint pain reliever.,"I was given this product by my doctor instead of hydrocodone they now refuse to dispense.They told me ""we've never prescribed it the doctor just grabbed the 3 day sample off the shelf and decided to make me their test subject. They also gave me 10mg of flexeril to take with it at night...DANGER BEWARE....This combo nearly killed me. First off did nothing for the pain I was experiencing from a ruptured L5 disk in my lower back. I only took 5 pills and boy that was enough.I got so constipated and could not go for 48 hours when I did it was extremely painful like pushing hardening cement through me. I stopped taking it the second day. I took the flexeril at night like they prescribed but unlike prior experiences with flexeril and hydrocodone this combo now made the flexeril act differently on me. I became highly anxious my eye pupils got very small and my heart rate was erratic and pounding out of my chest. I thought I was going to die I stopped both of them and tried to contact my doctor about my concerns by email but they won't contact me back. I looked online and all the articles say taking high dose of Ibuprofen and flexeril is safe.

DULERA,"I have late onset asthma (started at age 38) and usually control it with Flovent HFA and Albuterol as a rescue inhaler. When these stopped working, my doctor offered a two-week sample of Dulera (200/5 mcg). After just one use, I saw improvements in my symptoms. I began sleeping through the night again, and I was able to engage in vigorous cardiovascular exercise without needing a rescue inhaler during or after exercise. After using the full two-week sample of Dulera, I was excited to try a reduced dose, but my insurance will not cover a prescription. The cost is too high to pay out of pocket (>$300 per inhaler), so I am looking for an alternative option.","I was not on the drug, my husband used it and it gave me a side effect just being around him.

E.E.S.,Cured the sore throat which later culture info pointed to a staph infection with resistance to penicillins so this was a good choice for antibiotic. I might add this was a second try on this problem because the first was ENT and gave me nothing. The second GP believed me and did something and later on my own I found out the culture results that the first had never followed up on.,I think that this medication can be very dangerous and especially if its taken over a long period of time (for me around 1-2 months or more could have a serious affect on me) and people should be informed at how this medication can cause serious mood swings/depression/anxiety. This i feel should be put on the side effects list as there are others who have had a similar problem as i have had. I think that there should be some action taken on this if possible as i wouldn't one anyone to have the same experience i have had. Generally with this drug i think you should be very cautious and sensible and i think try to take the least dosage you possibly can as this will hopefully reduce these side effects or so i have been told.,,

Hopefully one will calm down the POD enough so that I can discontinue the Elidel, which has an application site cancer warning. Update: My dermatologist said that Elidel is safe to use despite what the FDA guidelines say about not using for longer than 2 weeks.

The next day after taking 3 more I got to about 5pm, having had a the same intense hunger pangs and gut rumblings all day, which ended up bordering on stomach cramps. I stopped taking them at this point having read some of the reviews here and contacted my doc who said they were a ""gut rotter"" and suggested clarithromycin. I saw a review somewhere else which tagged erythromycin as ""gut wrenching germ-buster"" which is so apt I nearly spat my seventh bowl of cereal all over my laptop. Needless to say, ask if there's an alternative because this stuff is serious. I got off lightly looking at some of the other reviews here and I'm thankful I looked.","This is possibly the scariest medication I have been on - Feel numb all over after 5 minutes of taking one.

Each woman responds very differently to the fluctuating hormone levels seen during perimenopause or to the waning levels of estrogen during menopause. With the release of the 2002 Womans Health Initiative study (WHI), there was a panic amongst the medical community and every perimenopausal/menopausal woman on HT. In 2010, the North American Menopause Society released their statement - which in essence says that a woman has to understand the risks and benefits of HT. The ELITE (ELITE: Early Versus Late Intervention Trial With Estradiol) at USC Keck School of Medicine is still underway. My understanding at this time, is that perimenopausal/menopausal women who have symptoms that interfere with quality of life should discuss the risks and benefits of HT with their provider. I had this discussion with my doctor and I decided to go on estrogen therapy (ET) at the very lowest dosage that controls my symptoms (I have had a hysterectomy so I do not have to take progesterone to protect the uterus from exposure to estrogens). I am on the lowest dose (0.0225) Climara patch (estradiol) which I started on about a month ago. My doctor said it would take about 72 hours to know whether I was on a sufficient dose, but the very day I started using the patch, I had my first good night's sleep in a very long time.

EXALGO,"I think I've tried almost every long acting pain medication out there and this is the one I stick with if I can afford it. More recently it has a generic which has become a recommended for many insurances in my state (that means the price has gone down dramatically from nearly $5000 for a month's supply to about $1500 out of pocket - with insurance I never pay more than $20 with the generic). It is the one long-acting pain med that doesn't make me feel like I'm dizzy or in a woozy state of some kind. I think very clearly and feel like I'm finally off those crazy meds that make you feel like you're always high on something. For me that high was unbearable and this is a great solution if you feel the way I do about many of the long-acting meds like this. Be sure to follow all instructions carefully though as there is a severe risk of death if you swallow a broken or damaged pill (these pills do not fully digest; there is a small hole in one side and the medicine sits in tiny pockets within the pill - any damage or crushing could cause the medication to release into your system all at once and cause you to stop breathing). I recommend these to anyone like myself who hates the feeling of narcotics and wants to feel like they did before they had to start taking pain medications. I know others who said this made them feel not great, but I don't metabolize most of the other medicines well (they go through my system far too quickly). I fully recommend this!","Overall, I like having a steady stream of hydromorphone. Just wished it lasted longer.",,

Initially, I did not any have problems with Flagyl, but over the years, I've developed an allergy to this medicine.

FLECTOR,"Started experiencing pain in my right heel when walking in mid-November; it got worse over time so I went to see my orthopedist in early December and he said I had plantar fasciitis; he showed me stretching exercises and advised me to get inserts for my walking shoes, wear cushioned house slippers and avoid walking up inclines. The pain lessened by following all these recommendations but I was still uncomfortable a lot of the time. I finally went to see the orthopedist in March and he said my foot ""can"" improve if I continued with the exercises, etc. At the very end, he asked if he had given me the ""patch"" at my first appointment; so I left with a sample and a prescription for the Flector patch. I cut a patch (there are five in each reclosable pouch) in half and it covers the heel area. After I used it the first time, the puffiness and pain were gone! I found it best to use the patch at night only although you can replace it every 12 hours. I put the patch on at bedtime, tape the edges down and wear a sock to secure it. Initially, I used it every night and after about three weeks, was able to cut down to several times a week. It certainly helped to make the past month more comfortable.","Started experiencing pain in my right heel when walking in mid-November; it got worse over time so I went to see my orthopedist in early December and he said I had plantar fasciitis; he showed me stretching exercises and advised me to get inserts for my walking shoes, wear cushioned house slippers and avoid walking up inclines.

That's when my sense of taste went awry. Everything was bitter except the taste of sweets for about 3 weeks. Everything seemed ok until November 2020, when I started to smell exhaust fumes. No one else could smell it. I called the fire department but they said there wasn't anything in my house. It continued so I had my furnace and chimney checked, but again no findings. The smell has so been overwhelming, finally I went to the ER with headache and upset stomach along with the fume smells. But the ER doctor said whatever I smelled was not harming me. However, I continue to smell it and it puts me in fight or flight mode. I developed anxiety and called an ambulance for my first panic attack because I felt like I was about to die. I never had anxiety but now it is through the roof. My doctor put me on medication for anxiety but i am afraid to take it. I am afraid of everything and small problems are unmanageable now. I am certain Flonase caused this change in me and my sense of smell. I also noticed jaw stiffness and I was chewing inside my mouth but I thought it was just tension.

GLUCOPHAGE XR,"Metformin caused severe exhaustion, most pronounced after each dose. It also significantly suppressed my thyroid function, even suppressing the effects of thyroid medication—causing exhaustion even with induced hyperthyroidism reflected in labs. The effect was so pronounced that when I discontinued metformin I experienced intense hyperthyroid symptoms I had never had before, from too much thyroid medication (which was no longer suppressed by metformin). Nausea, vomiting, exhaustion, anxiety all dissipated 24 hours after last dose of metformin.","The adjustment period of this drug is HORRIBLE! It's like the worst flu in the world times 1,000. Once it was in my body, and my body accepted it, it gave me my life back. I had no menses for almost 2 years the first time I took this, and within 10 days, my cycle was regular again. I went off it after about a year or two because I had to take 4 pills a day, and it became frustrating. My period became abnormal again, so again, I am starting it, and I am feeling HORRIBLE again. 100 percent liquid stool, can't eat or drink, or leave the house, or do ANYTHING. I am staying positive though, because I know the bad will go away, and I will have my life back within a short time.

GLYBURIDE,It definitely worked. Within 3 hours of taking the first dose my blood sugar dropped to the lowest I'd seen since I was diagnosed. Unfortunately it was way too low and my doctor halved the dose. Since then it seems to be helping. I'm not sure if I will keep using it as I'm a little wary of the interaction with metformin and the fact that it is essentially whipping my body to produce insulin.,"It's clear the side effects pile up on each other. Metformin made me feel terrible and I didn't know what caused it for many months. I gain 40 lbs on Actos, suddenly developed low thyroid and high cholesterol. My doc started me on Lipitor for the cholesterol problem and that gave me numb legs and terribly swollen feet. So I've ditched them all and will see which ones I really need when I'm on insulin.",,

HABITROL,"I smoked 14 years and very determined to stop. I used Habitrol 2mg gum successfully, following the instructions carefully. I stuck to no more than 10 pieces a day and kept at it regularly for 3 months. The gains far outweigh the side effects. However I also began an antidepressant about a month after quitting. I expected to try this at some point as i had struggled to use ADs before due to too many side-effects. Part of giving up smoking was to be able to use ADs with less side effects. I now have better control of my mood disorder. I feel good about myself being able to stop smoking. I believe I will always need some nicotine and will continue to use the gum, especially in times of stress. I do think people who smoke are attempting to self medicate some sort of illness (depressive or gastrointestinal or cognitive)I got Habitrol through quit smoking support,by a voucher system, so it cost me $5 for $80 worth. I now use 2-3 gums a day.","I smoked for 27 years and quit smoking 3 months ago with Habitrol 4mg. It's much cheaper than Nicorette gum and I break the gum in half, so I actually use 2mg (less $$$). At the (very difficult) beginning I chewed one piece every 2 hours, now I only have a piece twice a day and have replaced the with regular sugar-free Orbit gum. Works like a charm.

I was having headaches about 5 days a week and now every once in awhile.","It definitely helped my heart palps and flutters, and the craziness of severe hyperthyroidism, but the icy hands and legs has become intolerable (walking is painful and awkward...) and so is my indifference to everything... and I HATE not dreaming.. oh, and it never did get rid of the mild daily headaches I get, either... altho' I didn't have a problem with that as far as I'm concerned. But: I AM NOT ME, ANYMORE. I'm seeing the endocrinologist tomorrow to discuss this mess...",,

INDOCIN,I started taking this drug when it was first introduced in the 1960s as nothing else worked. Within one hour of taking the first dose I was symptom free. I did have to do once a week blood testing for the first year to ensure that it was not doing any damage to internal organs. Tests verified no adverse effects. A true miracle drug.,I had a hysterectomy on july 5 2021. I was doing terribly. They gave it as a suppository because i can't take anything in my stomach. No one said take with food. I have to sleep for atleast 2 hours. I'm extremely grateful for this medicine. Oh also the suppository helps lower abdominal pain.,,
INDOMETHACIN,I thought for sure I was dying.,"Took this drug a handful of times sporadically over the past four months. Never had any majors issues until now. Took one pill, an hour or so later, felt like I was about to die. Have never had a panic attack in my life before this. Absolutely NOT WORTH IT. Didn't even help with my pain this time around. Wish I read these reviews before going through such an awful experience like the one brought on by this god awful medicine. AVOID! AT! ALL! COSTS!",,
INDOMETHACIN SODIUM,Rash began to slowly build on body several months after starting this drug. Rash and skin pain built in body for many months before doctor made connection between drug and my body's toxic response. I was incapacitated for months (due to severe skin pain and fatigue) before new doctor made connection between drug and damage it was doing to my body. Pure hell - I will never take this drug again.

INJECTAFER,"I had a bad rxn to venofer (iron sucrose) and was terrified to try another formulation, but injectafer has been wonderful to me.

INTAL,"If you want to treat Asthma without Long acting Beta drugs, or without Steroids, it's had to find meds.

INVANZ,Update: never had any side effects,"First diver flare was one year ago, put on cipro/flagyl, almost killed me, developed lactose intolerance immediately, lost 8 pounds in one week, had to stop meds after 3 days, horrible thrush took two weeks to cure. This is NOTHING like those drugs. NO side effects, stool is loose but could be post diver flare, have not lost weight. If you have diverticulitis, REFUSE cipro/flagyl and ask for this drug IV every day (a bit of an inconvenience) but far superior.",,
INVEGA,It's ok,Terrible drug. Should be banned. Should have to take a brain xray before getting prescribed a drug like this.,,
INVEGA SUSTENNA,Wosrt thing thats ever happened to me was this drug. For 19 years of my life i was very fit loved to exercise loved music. Before the injection i was a lightweight w weed alcohol and nicotine. I was driven hardworking fit and loved aspects of life.

INVEGA TRINZA,It a good medicine but very expensive,I am a big fan of Invega Sustenna however Invega Trinza does not work so well for me and I had horrible withdrawal symptoms leading up to my next shot.

IONAMIN,I swear this pill is awesome i used it for two months and lost alot of weight its great if it werent for the side effects,"DO NOT TAKE! This is a pill from the devil. I've done all sorts of weight loss pills & this is bad. I couldn't sleep for about 2 weeks. Had severe unquenchable thirst, slight shakiness & slight rapid heart beat. Became extremely depressed & sad, crying about anything. Cried cause the wind blew my hair into my eyes, & cause I dropped my pencil-seriously. I became very easily annoyed,aggravated & angry over the most petty things. I wasn't hungry & barely ate which was good. I only lost 3lbs in a week, so I made myself eat a bit more & started exercising. I lost 8 lbs in 3wks, but was miserable from the other side effects. I'm normally a fun joking person, but became horrifically upset over everything & my crying was out of control,so I decided to quit taking. This pill is difficult to come off of, so I took 1/2 pill/day to wean off. It took me OVER a year to rid my body of all the side effects.

I think people only tend to add reviews of drugs if they've had a bad experience with them. I noticed there was a 1-star review, so I thought I'd add my 5-star review to balance things out a bit.

Because of the information on this website, I stopped taking the verapamil and the migrains ceased the very next day.","Worst drug I have ever taken. Started out with some minor constipation, nothing big. Then the drug started to lose It's effect so the doctor told me to increase the dosage to 80mg from 40mg. Went like that for a month, constipations grew ever so more painful and eventually one day when I woke up at 6-7 AM, I started having stabbing and cramping chest pains. Had to go to the hospital and once I'm there, everything checks out fine until a cardiologist presses and massages my heart muscles to recreate the intense stabbing pains and wouldn't you know it. the drug has essentially made sections of my heart to become inflamed, resulting in severe pains every 3-5 seconds.

Sore breasts for usually at least 2-3 weeks. Bleeding was also very very heavy and terrible.

Also, I take a very small dose of (less-drowsy formula) dramamine a few minutes before taking the dose, and I also can avoid the nausea. I would rather continue with this drug because it is the only thing I can do to tame my overactive adrenals.

KUVAN,"Before taking Kuvan my son was taking Adderall XR for ADHD which was associated with his PKU. He was taking 40 mg of Adderall XR and was experiencing a number of the unwanted side effects which can be associated with higher doses of Adderall. After starting Kuvan we were able to progressively reduce the amount of Adderall over time. At this point he is only taking 15 mg of Adderall XR. Subjectively this seems a little on the low side and it is likely his next prescription for Adderall XR will be 20 mg. Clearly Kuvan has been effective in reducing the amount of Adderall needed and we have seen many of the side effects associated with Adderall decline in line with the reduction in dosage. With this said, I think it's important for individuals who are taking Kuvan and are considering either a stimulant or a non-stimulant medication for associated ADHD to clearly review the dosage with their doctor as this may vary from the dosage recommendations for those patients having ADHD but not diagnosed with PKU. It's my experience that the physician prescribing Adderall for ADHD is most often not the physician prescribing Kuvan for PKU. With this said your ADHD prescribing physician may not have any understanding of the relationship between PKU and ADHD and the possible interactions between Kuvan and the prescribed ADHD medication. I go out of my way to ask these physicians how much they understand regarding the above and to the extent they are ill-informed I require them to communicate",Hard to justify taking this medication when considering the cost (240K yearly) and the efficacy of the product ( Only lowered my PHE levels 30%). However I still stuck to it for nearly 10 years. Note: I haven’t been on a low protein diet since I was a toddler. Once the anaphylactic episodes kicked in I stopped taking Kuvan.

Normally, I would be sick an average of 3-5 days post-op with such severe nausea/vomiting, I would became weak and dehydrated.

After my husband began taking Lamictal he started feeling ""better"" quickly. This led to sudden thoughts that he is in his right mind and should be focusing on him and his needs while his children and wife sit on the sidelines. He has now lost his wife and children and beleives that it is a good thing. He has left the house and is only paying for his room and board where he is staying and refuses to pay the bills he left with his wife and children. This is all very recent and who is to know if he will remain happy with these changes but he has very limited interaction with his children at this point and the effects on them have been huge. It does appear that he feels better but from what I see it is only better because he isn't reguarding any of the responsibilities that he has. Only time will tell how he responds when reality hits him but from what I have seen so far he will continue to withdrawl. He refuses to listen to my feedback about his treatment and has concocted a grand story in his mind that I am the root of his anger issues and with out me he will now be better. He has taken this to the extreme of simplifying our seperation saying that I just didn't want him to go hiking so I ended our seven year relationship and tore our children",They need to figure out what's wrong a person without pills to make us Ginny pigs its stupid,,
LAMICTAL ODT,"Simple to take, tastes pretty good haha. Only downside is that I have to keep the pill in the foil pack because they're incredibly sensitive to even slight moisture, so I can't put them in a pill bottle or in a weekly pill box. It's a 3 because I haven't been taking it long enough yet.","When I started hearing about treating bipolar patients with anticonvulsants, I admit I was intrigued, but I had so many bad prior experiences being a guinea pig, that I stayed away. Still, in the back of my mind, I kept wondering if perhaps bipolar could be a more subtle form of epilepsy. In other words ... brain damage. So with this idea in mind, and unable to afford androgens, I gave Lamictal a try. What I like about it, is that it appears to be naturally lifting my mood, without causing mania, and so far it's not changing my personality, which is the whole reason I opted for hormones over SRI's. As much as I have suffered over the years, I like being me. Lamictal also has calmed my racing thoughts, allowing me to concentrate MUCH better, but unlike a tranq. I'm still taking 600 mg Lithium Carb. per day and about 0.5 Xan., but hoping to cut out one or both of these. So far so good.",,
LAMICTAL XR,"I am medication-sensitive. I tried other drugs for my seizures: Depakote (severe adverse side effects), Tegretol, and Keppra. I like Lamictal XR because, unlike some of the others I tried, it has not caused hallucinations, a psychotic break, fits of rage, spontaneous sobbing, migraines, difficulty thinking, recalling words, etc. The side effects are relatively benign. My social anxiety has been greatly diminished because it regulates my brain. I prefer the XR version because it gives me a more consistent presence of the drug and, in my case, not having enough in my system always results in pre-seizure symptoms. On the flip side, it does take away any sense of urgency which used to spur me to complete tasks. Nothing is perfect. This works better than I ever hoped.","DO NOT TAKE DR REDDYS BRAND!!!!! I am extremely sensitive to medications and supplements. Keppra = rage and uncontrollable crying, Tegretol = severe Migraines, Depakote = hallucinations. Lamictal side effects are slight and livable.",,

LARIN 1/20,"This review is for Larin manufactured by Northstar. The estrogen content of this pill is too low. I doubt it has 20 mcg of estrogen. I’ve taken many brands of bc pills with 20 mcg and they do not give such side effects as these: yeast infection, severe fatigue, hair loss, feeling cold, body aches. All these symptoms immediately went away when I used my bioidentical estrogen gel that I have on hand. This addition of estrogen is what helped me get through those 4 months on Larin, otherwise I won't be able to function. After having years of clear skin with Yaz, my insurance no longer covers it, so my doctor switched me to Larin which was awful. My cystic acne returned and my face and scalp became very oily again. This is probably partly caused a rebound of acne from Yaz withdrawal. The good things I can say about Larin are that it diminished my sleep disturbance and low level irritability and anxiety that were caused by Yaz.",I've been on the pill for 9 days and on day 7 my vaginal area began to itch. I didn't think anything of it because it's a side effect of the BC. Then I woke up this morning with a swollen vaginal area. Now I'm in pain with a yeast infection. Would NOT recommend.,,

LODINE,"Lodine was the best of the NSAIDS that I tried in terms of keeping pain at bay. Mostly I did not want to move at all. After being sent for yet another MRI, the pain changed sides and I realized it was spinal, probably stenosis. I had gained weight and lost the joy of life, was out of shape. I also read that taking these drugs can lead to tendon damage. Diagnosed as Vitamin D seriously deficient, I supplemented with D, fish oil, calcium, glucosamine, chondroitin msm and multi vitamin. I started aquatic exercise, hoping it would not hurt. In two weeks I was down to one pill a day, in a month to none. I have lost 20 lbs and am on weight watchers and am taking kung fu classes--don't laugh. In all, holistic approach is working. The answer is not found in just a drug.","This is my second time taking this drug for TMJ pain. The first time I didn’t experience any side effects and was extremely pleased. I only took it for a few days until the inflammation was completely gone. This time, the first day went by again with no problem and pain under control. On the second day I was so heavily affected that I had to miss work. 20 minutes after taking the drug I felt exhausted and like I had to lie down. I started falling asleep and I felt like I was behind a curtain of haze. I was so fatigued that I had trouble talking. My husband and my father took turns being with me during the day so as not to leave me alone. It was terrifying and I will never take this drug again.",,

LOESTRIN 21 1.5/30,Great med! The worst time of my life was when I was off LoEstrin during fertility treatment: I gained weight; the fibroids grew back after 1 year instead of after 3+ years; my menstrual periods were heavy to the point of being debilitating; and I was close to insane due to the mood swings. I'll stay on LoEstrin as long as my GYN & Endocrinologist allow me to do so.,I am not satisfied with this medicine. I am tired of having yeast infections.,,
LOESTRIN 21 1/20,Don't take yaz. It works great at first and then slowly makes you depressed without knowing it. Ok to this birthcontrol loestrin 21. So far I like it. I haven't had any problems with gaining weight or bloating. No loss of libido. I am kind of excited to start my period (well as excited as one can be about something like that) since a lot of people say it's very short and somewhat pain free. So far I am happy with these pill,"I was wary about going on a BCP for fear of getting nauseated all of the time. Suprisingly I have not had any nausea or any other side effects except for a slight water retention. I am grateful the bleeding stopped at day 2 of taking it, and am looking forward to lighter periods. Before going on Loestrin 21 my periods were irratic and extremely heavy--almost a hemmorage.",,

LOESTRIN FE 1.5/30,"Normally a happy, easy going person. But these pills have changed my mood completely. I would sometimes sit there and cry for no reason at all, feel down and depressed. Since taking these I have become very argumentative with my boyfriend and also lost my sex drive. I go back to normal when I have a 7 day break from them. Discontinuing these today so I can feel like myself again.","The pill worked great at first, and after three months it all went to hell. Started having pain again like I had before endometrial surgery, had two normal periods and then started spotting throughout the month. Also over the last three months, I have not felt like myself, I am tired like no other and my moods and personality have not been the typical me. Not to mention I have been using the bathroom anywhere from 10-20 times a day along with leakage throughout the day. I use to only wake once if that, now it is at least three times a night at least a few nights a week. The fatigue I have is also out of my normal. I have always been a busy person, but lately I can barely get through the day without feeling like I am going to fall asleep. Not to mention I do not sleep well as it is. I am preparing to go to a urologist to check my bladder out, but something tells me nothing is wrong with my bladder, if nothing is wrong, I am going to consider going off these pills and I am not sure if I ever want to be on birth control again. My cramps may be awful, but it does not matter, pill or not I have them. I would rather deal with that and the irregular and heavy periods than all this crap!!",,

LORTAB,"Took care of the pain like it was supposed to, but also knocked me out. That was fine for me since I needed to rest anyway, but if I had needed to resume daily activities it would not have been okay.","I was prescribed the liquid form of Lortab to treat pain after my tonsils were removed. It helped greatly with pain relief. However, I was not aware of potential dependency, and when I stopped taking it after two weeks I went through rather unpleasant withdrawal symptoms that included severe drug cravings. I would come home, run to the bathroom and take a swig from the bottle. I never experienced anything like it in my entire life... It took another 2 weeks of slowly tapering down. Not a bad drug per se, just be aware of the fact that you might develop dependency.",,

Surprising, because no other drugs seemed to work. Basically, I went from 6-15 trips/day to can before the drug, to 2 times a day with solid bowel movements. In a way, it's a miracle. However, it has not done much for the fistula, which is still draining. The GI said he had had other patients use the drug for fistulas and they dried up. So, ironically, while I was prescribed the drug for a fistula, it has ended up working really well for the ileal Crohn's. Funny, huh? Also, it can only be taken IV, so I have a PIK Line in my arm, and I have to wear a fanny pack with a small IV pump, which is a drag. Requires dressing changes weekly by the nurse and 2/weekly tubing changes. Also, really crappy stability with this med - only 72 hours.

Since attorneys are guiding health care decisions and MD's have negligently rolled over, handing it to them, who can be sorry for this generation of MD's that look out for number 1 first? Themselves. The patient is last, if considered at all. Bitter you say? You are expletive right. When your healthcare is managed by an uncaring Attorney written protocol, trust me, walk in my pain inducing shoes. You'll quickly wake up. This is coming from someone that knows. I'm early retired Critical Care/Trauma , RN MS Specialist.UCSF '95. Trust me when you are on the receiving end of a Hippocratic, dying profession it hurts badly to know too much. Time an again I see where MD's have sold out their ethics to follow the all mighty protocol of so called best outcomes. Whose outcomes are best? The attorneys I imagine. If this generation of MD's doesn't wake up real fast and take back the power of profession that they have laid over and given to attorneys, they will be unemployed by an on every corner ATM attached computer kiosk that has a male/female urinals, and auto blood draw and video teaching, that replaces 20 Doc jobs at each installation.

MINOCYCLINE HCL,It's been great for my skin. Really helps the acne. I get my liver checked periodically because it can be a side effect but have had nothing wrong. Great drug for acne.,"This pill ruined my life. I had never had allergies or hives before it. Now seven years after taking it for less than a month I get hives almost every day triggered from foods I was never allergic to. The hives were so bad at first I had to take steroids. Dieting and exercising did more for my acne than this pill. I hate this pill, it should be banned for acne usage. Terrible and extremely unhappy. Wish I could give it less than one star, DO NOT TAKE!",,
MINOXIDIL,Don't use this drug !!!!!,"I did SOME research about minoxidil before trying it out - apparently not enough. Bought the target brand 5% men's hair regrowth treatment foam. The first day I used twice and couldn't sleep, so I decided to only use once in the morning from then on. exactly 2 weeks later I notice I have no morning wood, havent ejaculated in 5 days and should be horny. NOPE, my penis was damn near numb. Managed to orgasm while flaccid (never done that before). I discontinued the treatment immediately. Within 2 more days my testicles painfully shriveled up and felt very cold. 4 days, (and an ER visit + urologist visit) later, I was prescribed cialis and my symptoms have only slightly improved. my testicles have re dropped but they feel very numb and my semen quality is poor. With great determination I can get a 90% erection, but IT DOES NOT fell the same as just a few weeks ago, hell, even 1 week into the treatment. All of the sudden it was like a switch was flipped..... I really can't believe this....",,

MIRAPEX ER,This medication is extremely good at reliving RLS symptoms but also causes potentially life destroying obsessive behavior problems. I will be happy to share my experiences with anyone who is interested.,"Recently underwent Deep Brain Stimulation for PD with hopes of decreasing other meds. Surgery went smoothly, w/o any remarkable concerns. Meds-reduction is just the opposite. Due to ER version of Mirapex, was forced to stop cold-turkey. Withdrawal has been miserable. Although dosage was small, the result has been constant fatigue & drowsiness; uncharacterstically sleeping 9-10 hours or longer per night; unable to feel fully rested. Refuse to go back on it & am unsure of next step. Wouldn't recommend this med, for multiple reasons.",,
MIRCETTE,"With Mircette continuously on backorder, my PCAB Accredited compounding pharmacy is wondering if patients are interested in getting a compounded form.

MODICON 21,"I took Modicon a year ago for only a month or two before I discontinued using it. I wasn't dating anyone at the time and did not have sex in the couple of months I was taking Modicon. I stopped taking it due to undesirable weight gain. I'm a very petite girl (5'1, normally 95 to 100 lbs) with very high metabolism and I do not gain weight easily. Within a few weeks of taking Modicon, my face got rounder/fatter and my arms got bigger. A couple of my friends and even my mom commented on how I looked ""different"" and I could see it when I looked at myself in pictures. I hated the way I looked with a fuller face and bigger arms, and I shot up to about 105 lbs (very unusual for me). Since I wasn't having sex at the time and didn't need BC, I stopped taking it completely. I didn't change anything else about my lifestyle and about a month after I stopped Modicon, my weight went back to normal and my face and arms thinned out again. I have remained 100 lbs or less since! I just started Loestrin 1/20.. hopefully the lower estrogen level means no weight gain!","Helps bad cramps/periods, skin a little.",,

MONISTAT 1 COMBINATION PACK,The FDA needs to look into this mediation because obviously I'm not the only one experiencing this nightmare!,HORRIBLE. DO NOT USE.,,
MONISTAT 3,It's cleared up most of my yeast infection (not all of it!)but left me with a headache that won't subside. The first night after using it I woke up with a swollen face. My lips looked as if I'd had Botox injections. By the end of the day the swelling had gone down but the dull headache remained. I've used monitstat for years and never had a reaction before. I feel this medicine is toxic to my body and I've been poisoned.,Brought this thinking it would help an holy hell...I've never experienced so much burning in my life.,,
MONISTAT 3 COMBINATION PACK,"I would always recommend natural remedies over chemical anyday - however this is the first yeast infection i have had in ten years - forgot how they really suck! Tried garlic, but hate the way it tastes in my mouth even tho it is used as a suppository!It didn't help this time. Tried yogurt, and probiotics internally and externally /suppository for three days, no respite. As a last resort I went to monistat. So far it seems to be relieving the yeast infection (xtreme itchiness, redness, swelling but no scent or discharge symptoms) but there are side effects of heat and burning sensation for me. I think the more raw and chafed your skin is the more insistant and uncomfortable the application of the medicine / chemicals might be. I would recommend as a last resort if you cannot clear up an infection naturally. Prevention is the best medicine!","Just seen Dr. regarding my completion of taking Monistat 3 Combination Pack for having severe & terrible side effects. Dr. confirmed, stated I am having a SEVERE ALLERGIC REACTION to MONISTAT and that I was one of the WORST cases they have ever seen from using MONISTAT.",,
MONISTAT 7,I laid in my bed with an ice pack on my vagina. It made it feel a lot better.,I wasn't expecting to want to go to Urgent care but I'm on the verge of calling an ambulance. This is other level pain. My cooter has a heartbeat n it burns like the 1 chip challenge. This is punishment.,,

I LOVE IT! HATE MONISTAT!!!!!!!",,
MONISTAT DUAL- PAK,"This product is awesome. I used it before going to bed a few nights ago and it worked like a champ. I have continued to use the topical treatment and will through the recommended 7 days to be sure this YI is kicked in the ass! I have ""sensitive"" skin and had no adverse reaction (like the horror stories of pain/burning/etc I had read). The topical treatment started working immediately and really soothed my cranky and tender skin. Like others have mentioned, wear a panty liner if you are concerned about the discharge factor... I would definitely recommend this product!","i used the one day treatment because the itching was absolutely unbearable. there was a period of about 15 minutes after insertion where the pain got a lot worse, but i figured it was a small price to pay and it passed. 24 hours later i have minor tenderness/burning, but nothing like before and the external cream helps. ADVICE: make sure you'll have a couple hours to yourself after insertion and keep pany liners on hand because there was a lot of messy leakage.",,
MONISTAT-3 COMBINATION PACK,"I have tried treating my infections with yogurt and pro-biotics. If you use the yogurt as a topical treatment, make sure it is plain white yogurt that is free from any flavor or added sugars/sugar substitute. It actually feels pretty good, and it has worked for me. It takes a few more days to clear the infection, and it is a bit more messy, but it does not burn at all, and is all natural. I suggest applying yogurt many times a day, as needed. Of course, if it does not clear up, or gets worse, see a doctor!",Terrible reaction to the ointment,,
MONO-LINYAH,"Amazing!!!! Weight loss, no cramping, lighter/shorter periods, clearer skin, awesome energy & extremely high sex drive! Probably the best birth control pill I've ever been on!",This is truly the worst birth control ever.

It is much worse than the rash for which I was being treated. I would never consider using it again. It was so bad that I slept very poorly.",,
MUSE,I am pleased with Muse. I use 1000mcg pellets. I've learned that you have to follow the instructions to the letter. Urination directly before insertion of the MUSE is a huge plus in getting the drug to work. My Urologist suggested a small dab of Surgilube on the applicator tip before inserting into the urethera. This helps slide it in and minimizes discomfort. *Note using it in conjuction with Actis is a plus for me. I don' t know if they suggest this but I think its a great combo.,"The first few administrations of muse required some coaching from a health care professional who was knowledgeable and had access to resources on administering the 1000 microgram dose as well as the side effects. Had to pull foreskin completely back before inserting the applicator. The muse started to work at the base (very warming) which was starting to expand before the rest of it. During the expansion at the base, the blood vessels started to pop out so massaging helped to move the suppository to even the development of erection. Finally, there is the urge to ejaculate before the muse takes complete effect-especially the first few times. It is important that this happens to lower the intensity of the previous dose. The ejaculation was forcible and did not require a great deal of stimulation.",,
MYCELEX,"I tried Canesten 3-day cream (Canadian brand by Bayer), which has the same active ingredient - Clotrimazole - as Mycelex (American brand). I had developed a yeast infection after taking antibiotics for a bad bout of bronchitis. This was my first yeast infection. I had tried Monistat 3-day cream treatment and discontinued use after 1 treatment. Monistat was a horrible experience for me as I experienced very intense unbearable burning. I have a pretty high tolerance for pain so I was surprised how much it hurt. My doctor said I was allergic to Monistat's active ingredient or the carrier cream. I'm happy to say that I experienced NO PAIN or intense burning with Canesten/Mycelex. I will continue the full 3-day treatment and hopefully the yeast infection is gone for good.",I had 3 days on the troches but stopped when I got side effects.

NALTREXONE,"Patient groups are run by people who suppress any negatives about LDN.

For this reason alone, large scale safety (if not safety and efficacy) studies need to be carried out by experienced and unbiased university clinical researchers on patient populations that specifically mirror those who are drawn to LDN as a potential treatment.","I was a heavy drinker from the time I was 20 or so until I was 29. got Naltrexone 50mg.

To say Nardil works is an understatement, in my experience it is a God send. after all these many yrs it still works great. also, like some other people said, i never have had any problems with the diet, other meds, etc. it is very safe for me. so, in my experience Nardil is wonderful. i am so glad i did research and asked my doctor for it, who was happy to try it for me. best of luck to all.","it has been helping my headaches a lot actually but im so itchy ive scratched myself until i bleed, im so tired all the time and im always irritated because of it and my mouth and nose burn all the time. i want to stay on so bad because i went from daily migraines to a few a week but these other effects are getting to me, had good results with selegiline patch but terrible rash, going to try parnate next and seeing a specialist for nerve blocks in my head",,

I have a presumed auto-immune disease called Ulcerative Colitis. I've read research that nicotine helped control the symptoms of UC.

I am currently down to 120 mg of niacin a day (100 mg as part of a B-complex multivitamin and 20 mg from a daily Centrum), and my cholesterol is still good. I highly recommend you give niacin a try.

I can say this drug has helped me. I am thinking of upping it to either 15mg or 20mg due to increased anxiety.,,
PATADAY,These drops did seem to help the intense itching I get during certain allergy seasons. It takes a few days to really work well but it does work. It stings a tiny bit but not anything compared to over the counter allergy eye drops.,"It's expensive! $30 copay for 2.5 mil.

PAXIL,Lifted my depression fairly well. Still had a detached feeling though.,"This is regarding my wife. When she started menopause she started acting kind of crazy which is not uncommon. She went to a shrink diagnosed with anxiety disorder but this pill pusher ignore the fact that she was starting menopause and her hormones were all over the place. Instead of getting her hormone replacement this Pill pusher prescribed Paxil. I found out later why doctors give crazy ladies or going through menopause Paxil instead of hormone replacement therapy is because HRT lowers the risk of, ovarian, cervical and uterine and cancers. HRT also makes crazy ladies not crazy. Women have anxiety at four times the rate of men and is generally due to hormones. HRT also prevent osteoporosis in the medical mafia makes a ton of money treating osteoporosis with more dangerous drugs. Her withdrawal was absolutely brutal. The pharmaceutical criminals don't call it withdrawal, They call it discontinuation syndrome. This is an evil drug produced by evil people and prescribed by evil people. It's all part of an evil industry commonly referred to as the medical mafia. It's called the medical mafia because when it comes to disease and suffering they extort it to satisfy their insatiable greed. The only protection patients have are class action lawsuits by greedy lawyers. None of the criminals involved at his corporations ever even get arrested. The filthy Rich are above the law.",,
PAXIL CR,Complete life saver. Take it at night and it works best. I stayed at lowest dose and let my body get used to it. It did not take the full 6 weeks to work for me--saw great results sooner. I have zero anxiety now.,This medication was bad all around for me. Did not help my depression or panic attacks at all and made me feel like a zombie. Sexual side effects were intolerable. It was also very difficult to stop taking this drug. Terrible withdrawal syndrome even though I only took it for a few months.,,

PENICILLIN V POTASSIUM,"This is absolutely ridiculous, never in my life have I had a yeast infection. Maybe it's worth taking penicillin if you have a really horrible infection in, say, a major organ like a kidney or something. But for tonsillitis I think a weaker antibiotic would've worked just fine. I didn't even take it all, I only took it as prescribed for 4 days before it caused a yeast infection and I quit taking it. Because really, what's the point in attempting to treat a yeast infection when you still have to swallow the cause of it for 6 more days. So now the tonsillitis will probably come back, but I don't care. I refuse to take any more penicillin, it's not at all worth it.","Not sure this is doing anything I'm 6 days into a 10 day course I have to take 4 250mg tablets twice a day , my tonsils still have white spots and yellow bumps on them and my throat still feels horrible, I'd of thought there would be some improvement by now , I will carry on until I've done the 10 days , but it is making me feel pretty rough and not really seeing or feeling any improvement, disappointed especially if I have to take anymore antibiotics I hate them never feel good while taking them.",,

PENNSAID,This drug enables me to be much more physically active with less dependence on pain relievers. I can bike at fairly high levels of intensity for as much as 25 miles. I haven't tried longer but I'm sure I could and getting to that level was a great accomplishment. I have had 6 knee surgeries including 2 partial replacements. Use it before exercise.

PEPCID,"Had no idea these side effects could occur from an acid blocker that is also an OTC med. My research has shown that negative side effects like I've experienced are more common than what's indicated, and patients need to be counselled appropriately. Also, with these side effects, should it really be an OTC option??","Yes, Pepcid took away my heartburn and GERD symptoms temporarily. If you have issues with anxiety or panic attacks, DO NOT take this medicine. My anxiety and panic attacks were through the roof after taking this. I had the worst headache every time I took it. I experienced shortness of breathe and I felt like I was having an out of body experience (depersonalization). I also felt so much doom and gloom that I had to try and get ahold of myself.I was also lashing out at my family for no good reason, to a point of feeling angry.

I have been on a hamster wheel since I started taking this to relieve heartburn and GERD. If I take it, I get relief with all the horrible side effects, if I don't take it, I get heartburn and GERD that's hard to handle. This is an H2 blocker, PPI's are even worse. I wish I had a magic wand to get off of this stuff. The doctor told me it isn't possible to have the side effects that I do. Guess what? I know my body, I know I'm not a hypochondriac.

PRISTIQ,"I actually had my DNA done by a company that promised to find my ideal antidepressant. The service cost $350, but my insurance paid for it. I switched from a long-term scrip of EffexorXR. I dropped 20 pounds in days--have enjoyed the smaller body and weight loss tremendously. However, whatever control EffexorXR had over my OCD is completely gone with Pristiq. My moods are terrific--no big swings or drops. The OCD, though, has come back in a huge way. I have always been a clock fan--now I have dozens. They were joined by lamps and shades in the spring--filled the garage with them. I discovered ""upcycling"" old clothing--and like that, the lamps could go. The Habitat Store was delighted. I have been searching for the ""right"" ceiling fan--this search has become so burdensome, I was actually considering going back on Effexor. Pristiq is a higher-tier med than my insurance wanted to pay for, but I spoke with them directly and got it covered--due to that DNA study. My depression and anxiety issues would be ""solved"" if not for the ones generated by my obsessions with lamps, clocks, and fans. Even when I know it's ""wrong,"" I find myself bringing home something I sure don't need.","This drug was so bad I didn't finish my prescription and only took it for 5 days. I had been taking Lamictal 200MG for a year to help with stability and depressive episodes and Pristiq ruined the stability I achieved. It made me feel crazy and that there was something wrong with me. I never really felt ""crazy"" from Bipolar, just hypomanic with racing thoughts. Good thing that after a few weeks from stopping Pristiq, I recovered from the personality change, libido loss, and crazy feeling.",,

Even sitting was difficult. After taking midodrine I was able to resume most normal activities. It was truly amazing!,"This was prescribed after an a-fib episode that put me in cardiac icu for a couple of day. During my stay in the hospital step-down unit, I had a tilt table test which I ""failed"" spectacularly. I had been having extreme dizzy spells for a year prior, especially bad when walking or exercising (which I had quit because of), and sometimes even when sitting! Midodrine really is effective at keeping my energy levels up, and making me feel normal. But like another reviewer noted, it is short lived, so when the effects wear off in about 4 hours after a dosage, I start to have symptoms again. Also, it is ill advised to take within 3-4 hours of laying down, which sometimes is inconvenient when I'd like to take a nap, but then remember that I took my medicine too recently.",,

PROGESTERONE,Progesterone is depressive in some people. I cannot tolerate progesterone or progestin.

PROMETHAZINE WITH CODEINE,I had tried this medicine prior with great results. Maybe twice a year for 5 years. I'd feel a cold coming on and would take a couple of teaspoons and it coated my throat nicely and the sore throat was gone. However this last weekend with such severe flu symptoms I kept taking the medicine for the 3 times per day maximum allowed. After 2 days of this I had acute liver failure. Half of my body I couldn't control. I would fall down without any ability to control my body. I fell down so badly -- uncontrollably -- that I almost busted my head open against the edge of a step. This is the scariest thing that has ever happened to me. Please DO NOT ever take more than the recommended dosage. You will be sorry. I feel thankful to be alive!,This stuff is dangerous really is. Be cautious and don't over do it. I took 15 ml both nights before bed and nicked me out like a light to sleep and had no coughing but on the second morning when I had awoke I had THE worst migraine (never had one in my life) it lasted for several hours and was so excruciating I could not move hardly. It was my body withdrawing from the codeine. Sketchy sketchy,,

This is nothing more then 800 mg's of tylenol.","Because I had been under general anesthesia in the morning I am not sure this drug caused the headache. I took one tablet of propoxyphene napsylate/ Acetaminophen 100/625 before leaving the surgery center and another 3-4 hours later as pain in the surgical area increased.

Intramuscular shots of this drug were much less worrisome to me.",,
RESTASIS,I have been off Restasis for almost two weeks and still have insomnia. My primary dr prescribed Ambien and that hasn't helped. I will not take it again!,I do not recommend this very expensive product which did not work at all for me. No good.,,

RETIN-A,"Liking it after a month...looking forward to achieving more results! Remember, a Pea size pearl a day. Apply to gently cleansed face befor bedtime.","As a teen I never had an acne problem, but after going off the BC pill my face exploded with a constant stream of pimples, both painful deep and surface. Mostly they were in my T-zone but also some in my U-zone that were leaving nasty purple scars. I washed with salicylic acid 2x a day, used astringent once/day, washed my hair daily, changed my pillow cases often, stopped touching my face, stopped wearing foundation, etc. Nothing helped. Finally the Dr gave me generic Retin-A and it has done the trick. It gave me some nasty dry patches on my chin, but I stopped putting the cream there and hydrocortisone cream helped it clear. My forehead has never looked better! The cream tends to make me have small, unnoticeable blackheads instead of huge nasty pimples, and that's fine by me since they're small, discrete, and easier to pop. I use the cream at night on my forehead/nose after washing with Noxzema anti-bacterial cleanser and applying .5% salicylic acid astringent. I also use Noxzema cold cream in the afternoon daily as it really helps draw out the blackheads and dries out the rare whiteheads I encounter on my chin.",,
RETIN-A MICRO,"I love, love, love this product. I don't have acne or scarring but love the results of a cell/skin renewal product so I took it to the next level with a prescription strength. I saw my 40 year old dertmatolgist's skin and loved it - so fresh looking. I asked what she used and she said Retin-A micro. She said a lot of dermatologists use it themselves.

REVLIMID,This drug is amazing. It put me in total remission on 1/9/13.,"In all, this drug has been good for me so far.

ROCALTROL,"think this is an excellent addition to calcium, vitamin D regimen in lieu of bisphosphonates.","1969 I had thyroid Ca; parathyroid gland was involved & my body does not retain calcium well. My blood calcium levels hovered around 6. This caused tetany & made me feel awful; severe tingling everywhere (no outward signs of this, but I could feel tingling in my face, stomach, legs, etc.) and occasional hand muscle spasms. After taking .50 mg 2x daily, within 4 wks tingling/spasms ceased & blood work has been 8-9 (10 is perfect). Switching to new a Md., an endocrinologist, gave me my life back. Former Mds were of no help to solve this problem & some even thought I caused this problem by not taking my calcium lactate meds; I NEVER missed a dose! Very frustrating and some didn't know what tetany was; they thought I was saying tetnus. Go figure! I know I will be taking this the rest of my life. My only caveat would be to women who plan to or are pregnant. I would refrain from taking it then, as there are risks to the fetus. The formation of the fetus will actually remedy tetany during pregnancy. And yes, I had that experience while pregnant with my son. The tetany symptoms will return after delivery & you can resume taking rocaltrol.",,
ROCEPHIN,"I have read many times that it can be mixed with a solution of 1% lidocane to greatly reduce the pain. I wish I would have known that prior to both times receiving the IM injection of Rocephin.... no one ever offered it, but I would have definitely asked!

ROGAINE EXTRA STRENGTH (FOR MEN),I think its a great medication. However I would advise to try and take it early in hair loss as well as not having too high expectations,Please never take this poison if you can avoid it! The benefits are TEMPORARY but the side effects are either permanent or long lasting. I'm still 2yrs from recovering so I'm not sure if I'll ever get back to normal,,

RYZOLT,"Ryzolt ER was effective in reducing pain during the day. However, it seemed to bring back 10 times the pain at night. I would wake up howling with pain in my arms about 45 mins after I fell asleep. No amount of moving around, walking, heat, pain killers like advil, flexeril seemed to help. And no sleeping pills (Ambian 12mg) worked either. I consulted with my doctor and started weaning off Ryzolt over 2 weeks. The night time pain gradually faded away with that so this was clearly a side effect of Ryzolt ER. These symptoms were weird because it felt like the blood suppy to my hands was being cut off when I was lying down. I could see my veins popping up, my fingers were swollen and it the pins and needles turned to stabbing pain all over my arms. In addition, the paresthesia seemed to alternate between my arms at times. placing the heat pad on my neck and chest gave temporary relief. My Doc could not make any sense of my symptoms. Either way I am so glad it went away. Taking Ryzolt for 2 weeks left me depleted and worse off than before i had started taking it for Fibromyalgia .

There appears to be a connection between my heart and my brain (obviously) and I suspect those neurological symptoms could be due to minor heart-attacks which this drug effectively controls.

SLYND,I was actually feeling better on this but I have had 5 dizzy spells within the past week with 2 of them being today. Have dry mouth and thirst even though I drink a ton of fluids which I track with an app. One of my dizzy spells was while I was driving but stopped at a stoplight. I think I will need to stop taking this. I can't drive or work if I'm going to be getting randomly dizzy.,Had a period the month before the start of these pills. And now nothing worst pill ever.,,
SODIUM IODIDE I 131,"I pretty much went mentally batsh1t crazy with no thyroid hormones for six weeks. The reason there is no hormone replacement after the thyroidectomy is to make any remaining thyroid tissue or cancer cells that started life as thyroid cells avid (hungry) for iodine. No foods have any labeling that shows how much iodine is in them. Only if iodine is added to a food (such as salt) is there a way to even be certain there is iodine in a particular food. Therefore, really, a ""low iodine"" diet is guesswork which means the diet is about limiting the amount of foods you eat and/or the food the animal ate before you ate the animal. Now, for the super really fun part. Again, I-131 didn't, itself, give me any side effects. But, oh boy hey howdy do they scare you half to death with how radioactive you are. Every body fluid you make from spit to semen is radioactive. You can't use the same toilet, sleep in the same bed, eat off any real dishes, or be near other humans. All your trash has to be kept in its own bag and stored until it's no longer radioactive - which takes between 1 to 8 weeks (depending on who you believe). So, it's easy if you are a hermit. But if you are in the habit of living with other humans it's a royally huge scary way to live until you are sure you aren't radioactive anylonger.","I pretty much went mentally batsh1t crazy with no thyroid hormones for six weeks.

I actually quit taking it because I didn't like the low blood sugar episodes and risk of diabetes - which I'm at risk for already - or the insatiable hunger and weight gain. I tried Abilify and it was actually much worse. So I'm back on the Symbyax. I don't know if I'm going to develop diabetes or how long I'll be able to stay on this, but it really is the only thing that works.",,

This drug can have an ototoxic affect on hearing and with me it has. (Actually if you look up ototoxic drugs and look at the list it may surprise.) My spaced out feeling emerged about 4 days after starting it and is probably my biggest annoyance, but now after 13 days the pains in my leg muscles is also very hard to accept.

TAMSULOSIN HYDROCHLORIDE,Too many side effects especially sexual,"This is a difficult call and is only a best guess. The symptoms I've noted for me are those which I think MAY be related to Tamsulosin based upon what others have noted under Flomax. I should note I've also been taking Finasteride for 18 months. Overall I'd say there have been a very slow build up of symptoms over the years which I put down to getting older. However, the breathing problems seem to have mystified the consultants I've seen - low DLCO and KCO (both about 59% I think) but allegedly no other lung or heart problems and I've never smoked. After 2.75 years of no solid breathing diagnosis and out of desperation, and after finding this website, I stopped taking the tablets for a few days. Then the doctor swapped theTamsulosin tablets for Doxazosin. I took those for 4 days but serious itching was the reason for stopping those. I think they may have made things worse. I then re-started the Tamsulosin tablets before a uro-dynamics investigation earlier this week and I've now tried stopping the tablets for a second time. As before, the quality of breathing after 48 hours now better (the only way I can describe it), and as before when I tried stopping the tablets I actually feel alive and more interested. I hope that it's not a psychological improvement because I want to find a solution. I will hold off taking the Tamsulosin for as long as I can or until having a pee becomes too difficult.",,
TAPAZOLE,"Recommend it for Graves disease. Europe and Japan used it for standard treatment of Graves until recently.

TAZORAC,Just like the other reviews on here I too was hesitant to try a product that would cause all those side effects. My dermatologist prescribed it to me and warned me to make sure I use moisturizer before applying TAZ. I didn't listen which was a big mistake. I think had I moisturized the side effects would not have been as bad. The first two weeks were the most embarrassing weeks. My skin looked like it was sunburnt and it felt that way. I wanted to quit but I stumbled upon this website and listened to what everyone said. STICK TO IT! I'm in my third week and although there is still some shedding going in small areas this medication is GREAT! I already see a difference. My pores look great the blackheads on my nose gone and even the small fine laugh line that even my plastic surgeon said Botox or juvederm could not fix is near to hardly visible. I hope that this review helps someone whose about to start or is going through what I went through.

I would use this for seven days over monistat any one day for sure. I have noticed some small improvement but not as much as I had hoped. We didn't expect much, though, given cure rate for this type of yeast. I did however experience a sore throat and extra swelling and pain since using this medication. The sore throat is not accompanied by any kind of drainage or other symptoms, my tongue is slightly tender and swollen as well, so I'm thinking I may have a slight allergy to this medication.

Protopic and Elidel sucked and didn't do anything for me...all they did was make my skin burn like hell and my clothes greasy.

A scratch test from an allergist did wonders in finding out that I was allergic to dust, smoke, milk, dogs, cats, and many other things. A majority of doctors (especially HMO) won't tell you this secret information because they want to keep you suffering so they and the drug companies keep making money off of you.

Dad grew up on a farm, but Mom and Dad are retired and Dad hasn't lived on a farm since he was a boy.) Mom also had difficulty with mechanical things, such as operating the remote, microwave, car locks, etc. Our family doctor thought she had some sort of rapid-onset dementia. We followed up with her neurologist, fearing the worst, and he asked a raft of questions and did a number of tests. Tests were all negative, but there had been one recent change in meds: Toviaz.

If they don't resolve, I'll have to stop taking Uloric. Allopurinol raised my liver enzymes. Probenecid was ineffective. Am not looking forward to gout flares.",,
ULTRACET,It really helps for servere pain although not fast but it is very good.,"I started taking Ultracet because Ultram was giving me horrible side effects. Ultracet had less side effects for me than the Ultram, but it did not provide as much relief.",,
ULTRAM,Worked great for the burning pain of Interstital Cystitis . My body adapted and I found that I continually had to increase the dosage .,"I'm tapering off because, though I still need these, I want to get away from the horrible pain clinic even more. I reduce a quarter of a pill every week. It's bad but not too unbearable. The first reduction I cut off half a pill and it was awful. At this rate it will take me at least 3 more months to be off. At first when reducing, the pain is worse but then that evens out somewhat by the end of the week. I can't imagine going any faster than this.",,
ULTRAM ER,"(fyi,I've had no unpleasant side effects.) After starting this medicine,I began to lose weight, unawares. I was shocked when at the 3 month check-up, I learned I'd dropped 23 pounds. Now, after taking it 7 months, I have dropped about 50 pounds. Caused me to not feel normal hunger. I would begin a meal, but feel full quickly,to the point that I absolutely wanted NO more. Very unusual. Normally, I'd want seconds! This will cause your stomach to shrink. 2 mo ago,weight loss began to slow-thought it might be stopping altogether. I determined to help it out a bit.Tried to make sure I never ate 'tween meals, etc. I've continued to lose weight, w/o any real effort,but slower than before-probably a good thing. Only other possible cause for weight loss is use of a hot tub. About the same time as I started with the Ultram, after reading online about the potential benefits of hot tub use for Arthritis sufferers, we purchased 1; I began to use it-virtually every day for at least an hour or longer. (Husband built ""desk"" that fits across it. I go out with Bible, computer, etc & make good use of my time.) According to an online study,those in 1 for at least 30 min/day lose an average of 1 lb/week. Whatever the cause-probably a combination-the weight loss has been significant;that, in itself, helps any overweight arthritis patient. I'd be interested in knowing of similar experiences.","Ultram manages pain ok, first like a stiff dose of codeine for a week or so, then your natural tolerance kicks in, and makes it pretty useless. It was thankfully free of toxic Ibupro/aceto- But then I find out it also has an SRI action, and that typical SRI withdrawal nightmare.",,
ULTRAVATE,"Should not be used for longer than 2 weeks at a time. Works fine at reducing itching and plaqueing in psoriasis, but psoriasis never really heals completely.

When I first started taking it my large toenails started growing horizontally and becoming wider, to the point my toes would bleed next to the nail.

My foot and ankle also would swell up. My milk supply dropped where I am forced to hunt for formula and breast feed. With all this my mood was going up and down. I am heavy set sitting at 272lbs at 5'6 so I am sure that plays a part in what my side effects are.,,

VISICOL,"I'd read about electrolyte disturbances after taking this drug, so I prepared for it by making sure I was fully hydrated before-hand and that I took it with fluids that contained electrolytes (Propel, Gatorade, Apple Juice). It's a lot of pills to take, but they were no larger than my Vitamin C tablet I take daily, so not hard to swallow. I started getting results 45 minutes after taking the first pills, and it lasted for several hours afterward - around 5 hours from start to when I stopped getting the urge to have a BM. My procedure was scheduled for the afternoon, so I did the first round at 5pm the night before, then started up the second round at 5am the next morning. I didn't feel dehydrated at all afterward.

I suspect it would be best for those with lower energy from depression given it was pretty stimulating for me. Zoloft + Wellbutrin was not a good combo for me.

And I had to disgard it since it expired before I could use it up. This cream version is MUCH more potent than the pill form, which I have also taken before. It makes me dizzy and extremely drowsy within MINUTES. So I could only apply it at bedtime. And since it was so potent, I applied it VERY sparingly, which prevented me from actually using the whole tube and getting my money's worth.","in addition to it making me extremely drowsy, most of the time, did not get rid of the itching, and if it did, it comes right back. when it would put me to sleep, i can sleep for a very long time! i just cant believe my dr. put me on this drug in addition to me already taking 2 other antidepressants, ambien, AND xanax!! is this dangerous? and the only reason it was prescribed was to counteract a side effect of one of the other meds im on! oh, and another thing, ive been looking this one up, and it says it only comes in a cream. ive not once heard of it being a pill (which is what im taking, as needed). whats the deal here?? if you can relate, or have any advice, leave me some feedback.",,

It works ok with the combination of both pills , but 1- 10mg of Zaleplon alone doesn’t work at all ?? Any suggestions for other sleeping medications that might work better?",It works well when I am unable to RESUME sleep after having already slept for about four hours or less.,,
